## Phase 1: The Radiology Protagonist

> **Focus:** Motivating radiology teachers to be agents of change (4 minutes)

Learning Outcomes

Teachers will be able to:
- [x] Identify the core traits of a **Radiology Agent of Change**.
- [x] Differentiate between a "button-pusher" and a **Clinical Protagonist**.

### Core Principle: The Human-AI Partnership in Imaging

![AI in Radiology Workflow](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/dk/medical-imaging/ai-in-radiology/_jcr_content/root/container/container_1416664655/image.coreimg.jpeg/1695644545454/ai-in-radiology-infographic.jpeg)

> **"AI suggests findings, but the Radiologic Technologist ensures quality and patient safety."**

In the AI era, the teacher's role shifts from teaching "how to take an image" to teaching "how to validate and integrate AI insights."

#### Activity 1: Defining the Imaging Protagonist

Which action best defines a radiology teacher as a protagonist of change?

- [( )] Memorizing all AI algorithms.
- [( )] Avoiding AI to maintain traditional skills.
- [(X)] Leading the integration of AI quality checks into student lab sessions.
- [( )] Letting AI grade all student X-rays automatically.

---

## Phase 2: Case Study: AI in the Imaging Lab

> **Focus:** Learning from protagonists in Medical Imaging (5 minutes)

Learning Outcomes

Teachers will be able to:
- [x] Analyze how AI enhances the efficiency of an imaging educator.
- [x] Identify opportunities for AI to improve student feedback loops.

### Case Study: The "Smart" Positioning Lab

**Scenario:** An expert radiology teacher, Mr. Chen, integrates an AI-powered positioning assistant in the X-ray lab.

**The Transformation:**
*   **Old Way:** Mr. Chen spends 80% of his time correcting basic patient positioning for 30 students.
*   **Protagonist Way:** AI provides real-time positioning feedback to students. Mr. Chen now spends his time teaching **complex clinical decision-making** and **patient communication**.

### Activity 2: Discussion Prompt

```discussion
If AI could handle the basic "positioning checks" in your lab, what advanced clinical skill would you spend more time teaching your students?
```

### Multimedia: AI Transforming the Imaging Profession

## Phase 3: Simulation: The AI-Assisted Diagnosis

> **Focus:** Simulating examples and interesting exercises (6 minutes)

Learning Outcomes

Teachers will be able to:
- [x] Use AI to bridge the gap between technical imaging and clinical insight.
- [x] Demonstrate critical evaluation of AI outputs.

### The Challenge: The "AI Hallucination" in the ER

> **Scenario:** A student presents a CT scan where the AI has flagged a "potential fracture." However, the patient's clinical history and the image's technical artifacts suggest otherwise.

### Activity 3: The Clinical Innovation Simulation

![Radiology Student Simulation](https://www.ccga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Radiology-Simulation-1024x683.jpg)

As the protagonist teacher, how do you use this moment to lead change?

[( )] Tell the student to always trust the AI flag.
[( )] Delete the AI software to avoid confusion.
[(x)] Use the discrepancy as a "teachable moment" to train students in **critical validation** and **artifact recognition**.
[( )] Ignore the AI flag and just teach the traditional way.
*******************************************************************************
**Correct!** The protagonist uses AI discrepancies to build **higher-order thinking skills** in students, ensuring they remain the ultimate authority in the clinical setting.
*******************************************************************************

## Phase 4: Leadership in Digital Health

> **Focus:** Nurturing traits of being agents of change in MIT (5 minutes)

Learning Outcomes

Teachers will be able to:
- [x] Design a personal strategy for leading the digital shift in their department.
- [x] Commit to a peer-mentoring action in Medical Imaging.

### The Radiology Agent of Change Roadmap

| Step | Action | Protagonist Trait |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Explore** | Test one AI image-critique tool. | **Visionary** |
| **2. Implement** | Add an "AI Validation" step to a lab rubric. | **Innovator** |
| **3. Mentor** | Lead a department workshop on AI ethics in imaging. | **Leader** |

### Final Reflection: Your Action Plan

```reflection
What is the specific AI-enhanced change you will lead in your Radiology classroom next month, and how will you ensure your students remain the "protagonists" of the clinical process?
```
